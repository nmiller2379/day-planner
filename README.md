# day-planner

This assingnment called for a calendar application that allowed a user to save events for each hour of thd day. The assignment called for the app to to use an API to check the current date and time and use jquery to dynamically manipulate the DOM based on the time information from Moment.js.

## Struggles

I thought I had this project on a good track until I discovered at the last minute that I had a number of problems with my DOM manipulation efforts. I was unable to successfully fix those problems or address other parts of the app.
